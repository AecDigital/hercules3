# Hercules3Client

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `$> ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `$> ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

To generate new components, you must create them with: `$> ng g c components/component-name`.

Pages are the most important part of this project to get the best possible optimization. Pages (or views) has a basic and repetitive structure, than load only once, and their components, that loads when the user require them.
When you want to change any view, please, go to `components` folder and find the components that forms the page.

To generate new shared application components, create them with: `$> ng g directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module type-folder/component-name`. For example, to create a new service: `$ng g service shared/services/service-name`.

Please, respect the project structure. If you need help with Angular CLI to generate new components or need to know how to use the options of this command, go to [Angular CLI ng generate](https://angular.io/cli/generate#service).
